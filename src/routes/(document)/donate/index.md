## Support the Developer üíñ

Thank you for enjoying GDPF. We've strived to develop this application to be completely free and ad-free for your use. However, maintaining and improving the application requires time and effort.

## If You Find Value, Consider Supporting üôè

If you truly find value in GDPF and feel that "it's too good to be free," please consider supporting the developer. Your donation will help with the continuous improvement and development of new features for this project.

## Donations are Voluntary ‚ú®

Donations are by no means obligatory. GDPF will continue to be provided for free. However, support from those who are satisfied with the quality and features of the application and recognize its value is a great encouragement for the developer.

## [Easy Donations via "Buy Me a Coffee" ‚òï](https://buymeacoffee.com/canaria.computer)

If you wish to donate, you can support us through the "Buy Me a Coffee" platform. Regardless of the amount, your gesture will be a driving force for the developer.

## About Thank You Notes üåü

Due to the developer's time constraints, individual thank you notes are currently difficult to manage. However, we sincerely appreciate all your support. The donations received will be carefully used for improving GDPF and developing new features.

## Finally üéâ

We are deeply grateful to all of you who love using GDPF. Your recognition of the application's value is our greatest joy. We will continue to strive to provide better services in the future.
Whether you choose to support us or not, we hope you enjoy using GDPF. Thank you!
