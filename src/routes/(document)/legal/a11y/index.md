## Accessibility Policy for Web Digital Photo Frame

### Overview

**Application Name:** Web Digital Photo Frame  
**Purpose:** To display images synced with cloud storage, primarily OneDrive.

**Accessibility Commitment:**  
We are dedicated to making Web Digital Photo Frame accessible to all users, regardless of their abilities, age, or environment. Our goal is to create an inclusive experience for everyone.

**Accessibility Objectives:**  
We aim to meet all Level AA criteria and selected Level AAA criteria from the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2.

**Scope:**  
This policy applies to all web pages under the domain [https://onedrive.gdpf.2pc.nexus/](https://onedrive.gdpf.2pc.nexus/).

### Detailed Objectives

- **Full Compliance with Level AA:** We are committed to meeting all Level AA criteria of the WCAG 2.2 guidelines.
  
- **Partial Compliance with Level AAA:** We aim to comply with the following Level AAA criteria:
  - **1.4.6 - Contrast:** Ensuring sufficient contrast for text and images.
  - **1.4.2 - Audio Control:** Providing user control over audio playback.
  - **2.1.3 - Keyboard (No Exception):** Ensuring full keyboard accessibility.
  - **2.2.3 - No Timing:** Allowing users to control moving, blinking, or scrolling information.
  - **2.3.2 - Three Flashes or Below:** Limiting flashing content.
  - **2.3.3 - Animation from Interactions:** Minimizing motion-triggered animations.

These Level AAA criteria are included due to their significant impact on user experience in our application.

### Exclusions

- **Authentication Pages:** Cloud synchronization authentication pages are not covered by this policy as they are managed externally.

### Discrepancies in Machine Testing

While we strive for compliance, automated test results may not always reflect our actual accessibility level. WCAG guidelines allow for justified deviations, such as brand logos being exempt from contrast requirements. We carefully consider such cases and welcome user feedback on any accessibility issues.

### Policy Against Accessibility Overlay Tools

We do not use accessibility overlay tools due to their limited effectiveness and potential to complicate navigation for some users. Instead, we focus on building accessibility into our core design.

### Conclusion

Although Web Digital Photo Frame's primary function is visual, we are committed to making it as accessible as possible to a wide range of users. We continuously work on improving accessibility and welcome feedback to enhance the user experience for all.
