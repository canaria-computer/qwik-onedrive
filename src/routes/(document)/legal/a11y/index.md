## Accessibility Policy for Generic Digital Photo Frame (GDPF)

### Overview

**Application Name (Formal):** Generic Digital Photo Frame  
**Application Name (Short):** GDPF  
**Purpose of the Application:** The application is designed to display images synced with the cloud.

**Accessibility Commitment:**  
We recognize the importance of making our application accessible to everyone, regardless of disability, age, or environment. Our goal is to ensure that GDPF can be used by as many people as possible.

**Accessibility Objectives:**  
Our aim is to comply with all Level AA criteria and selected Level AAA criteria from the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2.

**Scope:**  
This policy applies to all web pages under the domain https://_owndomain_.example.com/.

### Detailed Objectives

- **Full Compliance with Level AA:** We are committed to meeting all criteria under Level AA of the WCAG 2.2 guidelines.
  
- **Partial Compliance with Level AAA:** We aim to comply with the following Level AAA criteria:
  - **1.4.6 - Contrast:** Ensuring sufficient contrast for text and images of text.
  - **1.4.2 - Audio Control:** Providing users with the ability to control audio playback.
  - **2.1.3 - Keyboard (No Exception):** Ensuring all functionalities are accessible via a keyboard.
  - **2.2.3 - No Timing:** Allowing users to pause, stop, or hide moving, blinking, or scrolling information.
  - **2.3.2 - Three Flashes or Below:** Ensuring content does not flash more than three times in any one second period.
  - **2.3.3 - Animation from Interactions:** Minimizing animations triggered by user interactions.

The inclusion of these Level AAA criteria is due to the nature of our application, where failing to meet these can significantly impact user experience.

### Exclusions

- **Authentication Pages:** The authentication pages for cloud synchronization are not included in this policy as they are not managed by our website.

### Discrepancies in Machine Testing

Our accessibility evaluations may not always align with automated testing results. However, WCAG guidelines allow for justified deviations where machine tests may not accurately reflect compliance. For instance, brand logos are exempt from contrast ratio requirements. We consider such cases carefully and regard them as compliant when appropriate. We welcome feedback from users and encourage them to contact us if they encounter any issues.

### Policy Against Accessibility Overlay Tools

We do not employ accessibility overlay tools, as they often provide minimal or no real improvement to accessibility. These tools can be redundant, as many features are already available at the operating system level, and they can complicate navigation for keyboard users. Therefore, we do not plan to use these tools.

### Conclusion

While the primary function of our application is to display images, which may not be suitable for individuals with complete vision loss, we strive to make GDPF accessible to as many users as possible through various means. We are committed to continuously improving accessibility and welcome any feedback to enhance user experience.
